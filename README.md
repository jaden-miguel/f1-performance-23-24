# 🏎️ F1 Driver Time Gap Analysis (2023–2024)

This Python project analyzes Formula 1 driver performance across the 2023 and 2024 seasons using real-world race data fetched with the [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) Python library. It calculates each driver's average time gap to the race winner — visualized side by side by team and season with interactive Plotly charts.

Designed for data analysts looking to demonstrate skills in data ingestion, transformation, and visualization using clean, modular Python scripts — no Jupyter notebooks required.

Made by **Jaden Ji Miguel**, July 2025

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **Live F1 data** via FastF1 (no manual downloads)
- ⏱️ Calculates **average time gap** to race winners per driver
- 🧩 Automatically maps drivers to names and teams
- 📊 Compares **2023 vs 2024** side by side
- 📈 Interactive Plotly bar chart grouped by team
- 🧹 Modular Python codebase, perfect for GitHub portfolios

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Set Up
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jaden-miguel/f1-performance-23-24.git
cd f1-performance-23-24
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

### 2. Fetch and Process Live Race Data

```bash
python src/data_fetch.py
python src/data_processing.py
python src/analysis.py
```

✅ This will create:

```
data/driver_time_gaps.csv
data/avg_time_gaps.csv
```

---

### 3. Visualize Driver Gaps

```bash
python src/visualization.py
```

✅ Opens an interactive grouped bar chart comparing each driver’s average time gap to the race winner — side by side by team and season.
